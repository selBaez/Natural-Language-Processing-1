    "\n",
    "The easiest way to get the required software is to install Anaconda. See https://www.continuum.io/downloads . It contains all required packages, including python and jupyter. You can choose python 2.7 or 3.5.\n",

    "\n",
    "Make sure that you have `numpy` and `matplotlib` installed. If you don't, you can use e.g. `pip install <package> --user` (python2) or `pip3 install <package> --user` (python3).\n",

    "We will grade your assignments with pass/fail/good, so don't forget to hand them in! \n",
    "Choose `File->Download as->HTML` and check if the HTML-file contains all your answers. You can work and submit in pairs. Please e-mail your TA with `\"[NLP1] Assignment 1\"` as the subject. \n",
